# Predictive Analytics for Hospital Readmission Rates

## Description
  This project uses machine learning techniques to predict hospital readmissions by analyzing patient data, such as demographics and medical history. The goal is to help healthcare providers identify patients at risk of readmission, enabling them to implement preventative measures.

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository 
2. Install dependencies: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Run the script: `python hospital_readmission_model.py'

## How It Works
  The project uses logistic regression to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. It preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, and evaluates the modelâ€™s performance based on accuracy, precision, and recall
